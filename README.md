# Farmgrove Project
In simple terms, this software helps to propagate farmers and local traders products to a much larger audience

### Problem Statements

* We are also trying to reduce food wastage by making it available to people that actually need it.
* We want to help local traders grow their businesses.
* Making farmers and local traders accountable, which will help in their decision making

### Team Ideas
* We can create a platform where people can just hop on and pay for products âœ”
* Our platform will provide interesting statistics on how well our sellers are doing âœ”
* We also expose buyers to variety of sellers to choose from, which normally isn't an option âœ”
* As the business grows, we'll start handling the packaging which will help with branding and advert âœ”


### Tech Stack
* Authentication, Database and Storage will be handled using Firebase
* Payment handling using Google Pay
* Cloud Functions for notifications
* React JS for building the UI
* Tailwind CSS for styling
* State Management using React Context


### How do we generate income
* We're looking at a potential 12% from seller sales âœ”
* Other than that, we'll be introducing running paid ads âœ”

### What we'll be doing differently
* An authentication screen that clearly distinguishes registering as a buyer or as a seller âœ”
* A wow dashboard for our sellers ðŸ˜Ž
* Our seller dashboard will have analytics and necessary stats which will help sellers narrow down their customers and who to sell too âœ”
* A simple but beautiful UI for our customers âœ”
* Taking into consideration UX and not building a complex software âœ”
